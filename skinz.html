        <h1>Remarkables</h1>
        <p>The Remarkables is one of the two main ski fields in the Queenstown area. The iconic ridge line is to many an escape from reality, with amazing skiing great snow coverage. With two new ski lifts in the past 3 years and a new base building, the facilities have been massively upgraded to fit the popularity of the field. With backcountry runs such as Homeward and Outward Bound and Lake Alta runs make this mountain pure bliss on a powder day. The new Suagr Bowl chair opens up so much more of the moutain and with it, so many more runs and lines for you to conquer. Opened in 1985, the Remarks has continued to grow exponetially, even despite the Covid-19 Pandemic. In the summer, the ski field becomes a beautiful scenic reserve with lots of amazing walks.

        <h1>Coronet Peak</h1>
        <p>Coronet Peak is Queenstowns heart. Starting as simply a rope tow in 1947, Coronet Peak has grown to be the best ski area in Queenstown. Although, sometimes coined as concrete peak, nothing beats CP on a peak powder day. With iconic runs such as Backbowls and Exchnage drop, it is perfect for the budding freeriders out there. With a brand-new updated Coronet Express chairlift, riding there has never been easier. Coronet also provides night skiing under the light which is a unique experience not many ski fields supply. Look below to sort out the runs that you will shred and see you up there.</p>
